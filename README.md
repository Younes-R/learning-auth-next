## Intro

I am trying to implement basic authentication and authorization in Next.js 15 with RSCs and Server Actions. This app has one public page, and two protected routes you need to be authenticated to get them.

Also, there is two user roles or types: students ans teachers, so each user type has some specific pages the other type cannot get or reach.
